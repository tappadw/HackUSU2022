# HackUSU2022

# Myself and two teammates created a stock trading algorithm that analyzes market data and trades using a mean reversion strategy. While it is not a live program, 
# it does everything that a live program would otherwise do. It trades stocks, analyzes and records market and trade data, and emails the user when a trade is made.
# I am currently working on a live version that will choose the most profitable strategy from a list and use it to trade on the open market.
